    <h2>About me</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I am one of the many self-taught programmers who seized the opportunity to
      delve into coding and web development during the Great Pandemics.
    </p>
    <p>
      My proficiency lies within the Vue ecosystem, encompassing Vue3, Nuxt3,
      Pinia, and Router. However, since web development heavily relies on the
      foundation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have acquired a profound
      understanding of these technologies as well. In addition, I have a working
      knowledge of MySQL, Git, npm, bash scripting, algorithms, and data
      structures.
    </p>
    <p>
      I offer a wide range of services, including the creation of one-page
      websites and small web applications. I excel in crafting fully responsive
      designs and optimizing websites for high search engine rankings with
      effective SEO techniques. If you're satisfied with the final product, I
      can even handle website hosting and maintenance for you.

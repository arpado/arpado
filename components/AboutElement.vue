    <h2>About me</h2>
    <hr />
    <!-- <p>
      I am one of the many self-taught programmers who seized the opportunity to
      delve into coding and web development during the Great Pandemics.
    </p> -->
        <p>Hi there!</p>
        <p>
          My name is Arpad, and I'm a passionate beginner web developer eager to bring your ideas to
          life. I specialize in creating responsive, user-friendly websites that
          are both visually appealing and functional.
        </p>

    <!-- <p>
      My proficiency lies within the Vue ecosystem, encompassing Vue3, Nuxt3,
      Pinia, and Router. However, since web development heavily relies on the
      foundation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have acquired a profound
      understanding of these technologies as well. In addition, I have a working
      knowledge of MySQL, Git, npm, bash scripting, algorithms, and data
      structures.
    </p> -->
    <p>
      I offer a wide range of services, including the creation of one-page
      websites and small web applications. I excel in crafting fully responsive
      designs and optimizing websites for high search engine rankings with
      effective SEO techniques. If you're satisfied with the final product, I
      can even handle website hosting and maintenance for you.
    </p>
            <p>
          Whether you're looking to establish your online presence, improve your
          website's performance, or bring a new project to life, I'm committed
          to working closely with you to understand your unique needs and
          deliver a product that exceeds your expectations.
        </p>
        <p>Let's build something great together!</p>

### "Ro-Shim-Bo"

The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without any specific framework. It follows a traditional approach with these core web technologies. To ensure code quality and reliability, the project is tested using Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework. Additionally, the project is bundled using Webpack, a powerful bundler tool that optimizes and packages the project's assets for deployment. Babel is used for transpiling the JavaScript code to ensure compatibility with older browsers.

### Brath's Landing Page

This project I developed was created as an application for a web development position. 

The work involved building a simple landing page for a professional meat products maker based on the given design template made by the designers at the company. This front-end app showcases various layouts, sliders, and incorporates a captivating parallax effect to enhance the user experience. The project aimed to demonstrate my skills in creating visually appealing and interactive web designs using modern web development techniques.

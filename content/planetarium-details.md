### Travellers Planetarium (work in progress)

This captivating 3D project leverages the Vue framework along with a JavaScript 3D library called Three.js. The project's core functionality involves sending API requests to travellermap.com and receiving responses containing the necessary data. This data is then utilized to generate a dynamic 3D scene. In cases where certain data is missing, the project employs randomly generated elements to fill the gaps. Furthermore, the project offers users extensive customization options, empowering them to personalize the scene to their liking. Notably, the project incorporates advanced 3D features such as camera controls, shaders, and the ability to generate numerous small objects in bulk.

### Kings Landing Page

The project involves creating a straightforward static landing page for the fictional city of Westeros. 

The page features a captivating hero section with a clear call-to-action (CTA), enticing visitors to explore further. It also includes a simple contact form that provides the address, open hours, and a map for easy navigation. Testimonials from satisfied visitors are showcased, adding credibility to the city's appeal. Additionally, the landing page contains two sections dedicated to highlighting the rich history and captivating sights of Westeros.

The entire site is designed to be responsive, adapting seamlessly to different devices. It should be noted that this is a front-end project, and no back-end code or functionality is planned for the page.

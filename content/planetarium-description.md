### Travellers Planetarium

The project was my first venture into React framework, and it was created specifically for the interview process of a web development position. To enhance the user experience, I incorporated React framework along with Swiper.js library for the sliders and cards functionality. This project provided me with an opportunity to familiarize myself with React and gain hands-on experience in its implementation.

### Travellers Planetarium (work in progress)

This particular project centers around creating a browser application for a tabletop role-playing game called Traveller, where the focus is on rendering 3D planetary systems. The application will incorporate a search bar that enables users to retrieve relevant data from the external website travellermap.com. Based on the fetched data, the application will render a detailed planetary system. Users will have the flexibility to modify the system according to their preferences, including the ability to add, remove, or configure objects within the system. Additionally, the application will incorporate animations to depict rotations, although it should be noted that it is not intended as a full-fledged simulator.

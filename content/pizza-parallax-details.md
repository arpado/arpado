### Pizza Parallax

The front-end of the website is built using Nuxt3, utilizing server-side rendering and incorporating routing and layouts. It also utilizes the Pinia store for state management. The animations on the website are created using GSAP. Additionally, I intend to incorporate a reviews section using SwiperJS.

On the back-end, the website is powered by PostgreSQL and utilizes the API methods provided by Supabase. The back-end is hosted on the Supabase server. The front-end fetches data from the server through API requests, and real-time order tracking is handled by the back-end.

The back-end features an authentication system with different roles, granting access to specific CRUD methods based on the user's role. The project's tests are conducted using Vitest.

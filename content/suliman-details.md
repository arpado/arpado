### Traveller's Suliman Spaceship (work in progress)

The project is a simple Vue 3 application that incorporates the Augmented UI CSS library to achieve a futuristic look for the user interface. The slider functionality is implemented using SwiperJS.

The primary focus of the project is to create an impressive parallax effect throughout the page. As it is a front-end project, there are no plans to include a back-end component.

### "Ro-Shim-Bo"

This application is a variation of the classic game "Rock-Paper-Scissors" known as "Ro-Shim-Bo." 

Users can interact with the app by clicking on a token to select their choice of either rock, paper, scissors, spock, or lizard to play the game. The app supports multiplayer mode for two human players, allowing them to take turns in a hot-seat fashion. To add an element of surprise, during their opponent's turn, player 2 has the option to turn their head to avoid seeing what player 1 picks. 

Additionally, the app provides the option to play against a computer opponent, allowing users to test their skills against an AI. For curious scenarios or experimentation, two computer players can also play against each other.

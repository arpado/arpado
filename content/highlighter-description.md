### Word Highlighter

This project is designed to assist a friend in teaching grammar to students in a more effective way. The application allows for inputting a sentence and then dynamically setting boxes around individual words. By using a dropdown menu and clicking on the words, users can assign different background colors to group them together based on their grammar properties. This feature helps visually mark the words that belong together in order to facilitate understanding and learning.
